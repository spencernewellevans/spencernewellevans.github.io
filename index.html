    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Healthcare statistics for Canada’s northern regions reveal that the healthcare needs of northern communities are not being properly met.  Residents of Canada’s northern regions face health challenges such as high risk of infectious disease, long specialist wait times, poor mental health and more. This website reviews healthcare statistics of Canada’s northern regions for the purpose of identifying major issues present in northern Canadian healthcare. These statistics are compared with other arctic regions in an attempt to identify the ways that healthcare systems of other regions overcome these challenges. Major issues identified with northern healthcare are distance from healthcare centres, long wait times for specialized care, and lack of consistent, reliable care. Telemedicine is proposed as a method of improving these issues. Statistics for telemedicine are reviewed to determine if it is a viable strategy to improve healthcare in northern Canada. Several telemedicine studies are presented and simple cost analysis is provided. It is demonstrated that full-scale implementation of telemedicine has the potential to significantly improve healthcare accessibility and reliability.
